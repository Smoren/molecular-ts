# Molecular simulation

This project is an experiment that visualizes the behavior of particles
in two-dimensional and three-dimensional space:

* Collisions and rebounds of particles upon contact.
* Simulation of forces of attraction and repulsion between particles.
* Building connections between particles and the influence of other particles on these connections.
* The influence of temperature and other environmental factors on the behavior of particles.
